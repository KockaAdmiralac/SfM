# Project Title

Summer project in "Petnica" science center, Serbia. 

Goal of project was comparing combinations of algorithms used to solve Structure from Motion.
You can read more about structure from motion on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), you need odometry data
tbw.
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the repo using

```
git clone git@github.com:KockaAdmiralac/SfM.git
```

Edit the CMakeLists.txt in order to get it running on your system, send me a message if you can't solve it by yourself.
```
Edit CmakeLists.txt
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
tbw.
## Running the tests


You can open the code in any editor of your choice, in order to compile it you can use these commands:

Run it on one sequence, one combination of algorithms
```
./metrics idk what the arguments are
```

Run it on one sequence, multiple combinations of algorithms
```
idk, must take a look at the code
```
